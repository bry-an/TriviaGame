# Trivial Chemistry
This is a time-based trivia game consisting of ten questions with 20 seconds to answer each question. 

The subject matter is general chemistry. 

## More about this project
It relies heavily on JavaScript's setInterval() and setTimeout() functions to control the time allotment for each question as well as display the time remaining. 

## How you can help
More chemistry questions could be added to questions array. The game's functions should be flexible enough to handle additional elements without changes.
